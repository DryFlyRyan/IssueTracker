# IssueTracker

### Description

This is a simple kanban board that will link up to a user's GitHub account through the use of a Personal Token.

It was made in order to get a feel for and demonstrate my ability to use the various types of technology used in the project including:

* React Hooks
* HTML5 Drag and Drop API via React DND
* Styled Components
* Redux
* Redux Saga
* Redux-First-Router

It was built on a `create-react-app` bootstrap that's been heavily customized by myself over the past couple years.

### Startup Instructions

Before starting, make sure that you have a GitHub personal token, which you can acquire from here once you're logged in:
